# Unit-7Train

This project allows a user to create a train line and it's schedule.     It will also allow the user to also see the lines that are already established and their arrival time and schedule.

This project will be useful if you want to track the schedule of a train in real time and find out where a train line of the user's choice would fall in comparison.

If you have any questions, please Slack me a message.
I will maintain this project but it is only here with the tremendous help from my teacher and tutor.
